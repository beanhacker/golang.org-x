# Go 1.9 Release Party

We're preparing a whole week of release parties to celebrate Go 1.9 all
around the world.

The events will happen around the world, starting from
Sydney on August 17, and ending with San Francisco on the 25th.

If you're organizing a release party in between those
dates, please send a Pull Request adding all of
the corresponding information:

- date and time
- location
- link to registration page (meetup.com or other)

One of the talks of the event must be about Go 1.9. We will provide slides
for this talk, but feel free to create your own.

Please, keep these in chronological order.
